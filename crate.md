# Crate
This is a rolling release of commonly used elements to help people build and maintain websites.
It focuses on using [Advanced custom fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) and a simple function called [get_component](https://github.com/stagfoo/Crate/blob/master/builder/function/get_component.php)
