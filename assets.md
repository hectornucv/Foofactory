# Assets
Assets are broken up into some easy to understand folders.

##Fonts
This is where you put any fonts you would like to call. They will be moved into the `dist` folder under the folder `dist/fonts`.

##Img
This will be moved from `img` into `dist/img` and only move the images called by the scss. (Needs Testing)

##Js
The `main.js` is the main driver of webpack and allows for easy to use require statements to import JavaScript dependencies. This theme does not use Bower. Currently a work in progress but we will be implementing the module design pattern into the included JavaScript files.

##Scss
`bundle.scss`
`npm.scss`
